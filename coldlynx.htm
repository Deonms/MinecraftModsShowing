<h2>Deathzone:</h2>
<p>Survive a with Horror infused Modpack, featuring the "Apotheosis" Mod, many Scps (+Scp Foundation), the Man from the Fog, The Knocker and many other Horror Elements that will make it harder for you to survive... Go through a World that is haunted by Deoms like the Man from the Fog (aka the Night Dweller) that spawns at Night and attacks when you least suspect it, or the Knocker that will send you Chills down your Spine as you go through your daily adventures. With the Apotheosis Mod you can create powerful Weapons to defend yourself and fight back against the Deoms lurking in your World, but beware, as there are also Scps (Special Containment Procedures) escaping the Scp Foundations scatherered all around your World...
<br>Good Luck on your Journey Survivor... You will need it..
