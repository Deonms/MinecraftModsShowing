<h2>CWB Recipe's:</h2>
<p>I added some recipe's AND some items, some used for crafting and some weapons and armor!
<br>
<br>Some recipe's i added are recipes i think should be in the game.
<br>
<br>Some of the recipes that i added are previously uncraftable items that are now craftable!
<br>
<br>Some of the recipes are not really usefull but you can now craft dirt, probably pretty handy when playing skyblock! And some are just reverse crafting like netherwart blocks turn into netherwart.
<br>
<br>I am looking forward to adding your suggestions to the mod!</p>
